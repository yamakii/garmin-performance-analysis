=== Phase 4: Parallel Execution & Configuration Tuning ===

Performance Improvements:
- Phase 3 Baseline (Sequential): 29.17s (592 tests)
- Phase 4 Final (Parallel -n 4): 12.23s (592 tests)
- Total Improvement: 58% reduction (29.17s â†’ 12.23s)

Overall Project Performance:
- Initial Baseline (Phase 0): 40s
- Phase 1 (Fixture Optimization): ~30s (25% reduction)
- Phase 2 (Time Mocking): ~28.5s (29% reduction)
- Phase 3 (Slow Markers): ~29s (27.5% reduction for regular runs)
- Phase 4 (Parallel + Config): 12.23s (69% reduction from baseline!)

Configuration Highlights:
- pytest-xdist 3.8.0 installed
- Parallel execution with -n 4 workers (stable, no race conditions)
- Optimized addopts: --tb=short, --disable-warnings, --maxfail=5, --durations=10
- Explicit test collection patterns (python_files, python_classes, python_functions)
- Cache directory optimization

Test Stability:
- All 592 tests pass
- No race conditions with -n 4 (unlike -n auto which had database conflicts)
- 24 warnings (expected deprecation warnings)

Notes:
- -n auto (16 cores) achieved 12.33s but had race conditions in DB tests
- -n 4 is the optimal balance of speed and stability
- Configuration now provides 10 slowest tests by default for ongoing monitoring
