# RAG System Project Documentation

**Project Name**: Garmin Performance Data RAG System
**Start Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Phase 0-2 Complete, Phase 3 Planned
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system implementation for Garmin running performance data analysis.

### Purpose

The RAG system enables efficient querying and analysis of Garmin running data through:
- Advanced filtering by training type, temperature, and distance
- Statistical correlation analysis between wellness and performance metrics
- Natural language insights generation
- "Why" question answering capabilities

### Target Users

- Primary: User (runner using Garmin data for training optimization)
- Secondary: Claude Code (AI assistant for ongoing development)

## Key Achievements (Phase 0-2)

### Phase 0: Data Inventory ✅
- Analyzed DuckDB schema (3 tables, 48 activities)
- Designed 4-component RAG architecture
- Identified no critical data gaps

### Phase 1: Core Query Tools ✅
- Implemented 3 query tools (comparison, trends, insights)
- Registered 3 MCP tools
- Fixed token limit issue (pagination)
- All tests passing (100%)

### Phase 2.1: Advanced Filtering ✅
- Activity classification (6 training types)
- 3 filter parameters (type, temperature, distance)
- 5 practical tests successful
- User validation confirmed (fatigue detection ✅)

### Phase 2.2: Skip Decision ⏭️
