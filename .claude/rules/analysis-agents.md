# Analysis Agents Common Rules

5 section analysis agents (split, phase, efficiency, environment, summary) share these rules.

## Data Access

- Use MCP tools only (`mcp__garmin-db__*`)
- NEVER direct DuckDB queries or file access

## Independence

- Each agent operates independently - do NOT reference other section analyses
- Do NOT create dependencies between agents
- Get all needed data from MCP tools directly

## Output Language

- Analysis text: Japanese
- Code, key names, field names: English

## DB Save

- Use `insert_section_analysis_dict()` to save results
- Do NOT include metadata - it is auto-generated by the tool
- Do NOT create files - save to DuckDB only

## Star Rating Format

Format: `(rating N.N/5.0)` with star marks and numeric score on a new line.

Example: `(stars 4.0/5.0)`

## Writing Style

- Natural Japanese sentences (avoid noun-ending style / taitomei)
- Coach-like tone: praise strengths, suggest improvements positively
- Use specific numbers in text (e.g., "XX sec/km faster")
- Keep comments concise (1-2 sentences per point)
- Data formatting is NOT needed - data is displayed separately in reports
